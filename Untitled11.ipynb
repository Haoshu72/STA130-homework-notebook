The \"first pre-lecture video\" (above) describes hypothesis testing as addressing \"an idea that can be tested\", and the end of the video then discusses what our actual intended purpose in setting up a null hypothesis is. What is the key factor that makes the difference between ideas that can, and cannot be examined and tested statistically? What would you describe is the key \"criteria\" defining what a good null hypothesis is? And what is the difference between a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis in the context of hypothesis testing? Answer these questions with concise explanations in your own words.\n",
    "(1)The key to statistically-testable ideas is to be measurable and supported by data. If the idea can not be supported by measurable data, mostly people's subjective ideas, it can not be tested statistically.\n",
    "(2)A good null hypothesis must be explicit, concrete, and testable. It should state a position and have plenty of data to back it up.\n",
    "(3)The null hypothesis (H₀) indicates that the hypothesis assume nothing happen, on the other hand, the alternative hypothesis (H₁) indicates that there assume something happen. The two are opposed and can only support one or the other. The purpose of hypothesis testing is to determine whether there is enough data to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n"

    "\n",
    "H0 and Ha are opposite, we put what we want to prove in Ha. But since proving Ha requires ensuring that it is correct in many cases, which is difficult, we now default that H0 is true, if we cannot prove H0 is true, we can conclude that Ha is true, and vice versa. Therefore, we should assume that the null hypothesis is correct to calculate the p-value. For example, in the video, we assume that the H0 puppy is innocent, which is correct, but we find that the P-value is very small in this case, which can overturn the null hypothesis, which is wrong, and draw the correct conclusion.\n",

Explain why this is in your own words in a way that makes the most sense to you, clarifying the meaning of any technical statistical terminology you use in your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating the p-value, we assume that the null hypothesis is true, which helps us understand how likely the data we collect is if the null hypothesis holds. If the p-value is very small, it indicates that the observed data is unusual in the case that the null hypothesis holds, thus providing stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. Therefore, we may reject the null hypothesis and conclude. On the other hand, a large P-value indicates that the observed data is consistent with what we would expect if the null hypothesis were true, which means that the null hypothesis is true. For example, in the video about the dog, if the null hypothesis is that the dog is innocent, then by default, the garbage cover on its head can only be done by others, but in fact, it is extremely unlikely that the neighbor enters the house to put the garbage cover on the dog, and the P-value is very small. However, the litter cap did appear on the dog's neck, so the null hypothesis is wrong, and the dog put the litter cap on itself."

    "A p-value is a probability between 0 and 1, which is a range rather than an exact value. It helps to evaluate the consistency of observational data with the null hypothesis. A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, while a larger P-value indicates weaker evidence. However, the P-value does not provide absolute certainty because it only measures the probability of the data under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. There are also two possible errors: Type 1 errors (false positives), where we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true; Type 2 error (false negative), when the null hypothesis is false we cannot reject it. In Fido's case, the P-value can only indicate the strength of the evidence, and cannot definitively prove innocence or non-innocence, since it is never absolute evidence."

Key changes included removing the symmetric statistic calculations and lower tail shading, adjusting the upper tail shading to highlight the relevant area for the single-tailed test, and updating the plot title accordingly. Each modification was explained to clarify its impact on visualization and statistical interpretation. Additionally, you outlined methodologies for calculating p-values for both types of tests, shared sample Python code using the scipy.stats module, and discussed the interpretation of p-values, noting the differences in significance thresholds between single-tailed and double-tailed tests.\n",
